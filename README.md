# Evening-At

As restaurants are increasing day by day , some people get to dine-in alone. 
They book their reservation for the restaurants where they used to visit alone. 
An application through which people can find each other, chat to each other and
book reservations at the hotels and become friends after meeting each other. 
Now all the reservations come at one place and are handled by the application 
where hotels then do amendments accordingly. This is React Native implementation 
targeting iOS & Android.

## Requirements

For iOS:
1. OS X - This repo contains the iOS implementation, and for that we needed Xcode which runs on Mac.
For Android:
1. Android - Make sure that you can run adb from android studio.

## Quick start

Get up and running with our Movies sample app:

1. Once you have the repo cloned using 
```
git clone https://github.com/MDABRARJAHIN/evening-at.git
```
and met all the requirements above, start the
packager that will transform your JS code on-the-fly:
```
npm install
npm start
```
2. Build and run the project with the Xcode/Android Studio run button.

You should now see the Evening-At app running on your simulator.
Congratulations!  You've just successfully run your first React Native app.
